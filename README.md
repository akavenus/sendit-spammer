# sendit-spammer
This is a script used to spam sendit (an anonymous message platform)

To use this you need a few values which include: a sticker id, an author shadow token, and an recipient id

All of these values can be found by opening the network tab on devtools on your browser and looking for the post request that sends when you submit a message.

When the request sends, simply look at the payload and all of these values will be here
